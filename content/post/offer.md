Trips are designed so there will be a reliable internet connection and office space available at all times for Dapp Teams, BPs, Token Holders , Investors etc . 

We understand that running a billion dollar blockchain network is a 24/7 operation but we don't think that should limit your ability to make the world your office. Tap into your inner digital nomad, finish your work and hit the beach or hike in the cloud forest!

All group activities are optional and will take up half the day so there is always plenty of time to catch up with telegram , update to the latest release of nodeos , fix that bug in your code and all that fun stuff that EOS teams do.

Trips can be customized to match specific goals for each team. Some examples include:

 - Costa Rica Crypto Interview
 - Knowledge sharing and networking
 - Hackathons
 - Development sprints (co working space available)
 - General Wellness (exercise, healthy food, relaxation)
 - Learning Sessions / Team Training
 - Create content / media coverage / film + photography
