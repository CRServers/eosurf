Our mission is to develop a whole new way to discover EOS and **find the optimal balance between WORK and LIFE**. Whether youâ€™re a dApp developer, a block producer team, an adventurous token holder, or an executive looking to learn about EOS, you are welcome to join us. EOSurf allows you to participate in the EOS ecosystem while staying in a beautiful country, working, staying active and networking with other EOS professionals. 

At EOSurf you can look forward to sunsets on the beach, jungle hikes or hacking til dawn while connecting with people from all over the planet.

Discover your true potential while learning new skills and refining your talents. Here you can develop your dApp or bring your team for some EOS networking. The idea is to leave inspired and energized to keep charging towards your goals.
