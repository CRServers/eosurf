      <description>You take care of your airfare and we take care of everything else. We will arrange for an airport pickup and bring you to the location where you can share or have your own private accommodation. We will have already asked you about your goals and your preferences regarding every detail of your trip and any extra activities like stand up paddle boarding, zip lining or horseback riding. After your stay weâ€™ll give you all your photos, video footage and even a bespoke film about your week with us.</description>
