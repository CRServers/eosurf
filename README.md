## What is SurfEOS?
A whole new way to discover EOS and **find the optimal balance between WORK and LIFE (or LIFE / EOS)** . Whether you’re a dApp developer, a block producer, an adventurous token holder, or a surfer looking for EOS paradise, you are welcome at SurfEOS. Participate in the EOS ecosystem while staying in a beautiful country, eating, working, surfing, exploring, and networking with other EOS professionals. 

When you visit with us, you join our family and we strive to have something for everyone. Sunsets on the beach, jungle hikes or hacking til dawn while connecting with people from all over the planet.

Discover your true potential while learning new skills and refining your talents. Here you can develop your dApp or bring your team for some EOS networking. The idea is to leave inspired and energized to keep charging towards your goals.

### What we offer
Trips are designed so there will be a reliable internet connection and office space available at all times for Dapp Teams, BPs, Token Holders , Investors etc . 

We understand that running a billion dollar blockchain network is a 24/7 operation but we don't think that should limit your ability to make the world your office. Tap into your inner digital nomad and find your ideal workspace right on the beach or atop a mountain!

All group activities are optional and will take up half the day so there is always plenty of time to catch up with telegram , update to the latest release of nodeos , fix that bug in your code and all that fun stuff that EOS teams do.

Trips can be customized to match specific goals for each team. Some examples include:

 - [Costa Rica Crypto Interview](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHPQbgCohxxg49zYrAFu_9Q/featured)
 - Create content / media coverage / film + photography
